| **Finalize Code (Address TODOs)**      | **Resolve all `TODO` comments and incomplete features.** Go through the code and implement any unfinished functionality marked with TODO. This ensures no critical feature is left half-done. For example, if there are TODOs for error handling, edge cases, or support for certain data types, implement those before release. All placeholders should either be completed or removed. This will improve code completeness and reliability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Example Usage Integration**          | **Provide a clear example of how to use the library with LangGraphJS.** Create a practical usage example to demonstrate integration. This could be an `examples/` folder with a small script or a detailed code snippet in the README. The example should show how to initialize a Firestore checkpoint in a LangGraphJS workflow, illustrating the typical setup (e.g., Firestore configuration, creating a checkpoint, restoring from a checkpoint). This helps users understand the library in context and verifies it works with LangGraphJS’s latest API.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Comprehensive README Documentation** | **Overhaul the README.md for clarity and completeness.** Include a project description, installation instructions (`npm install @cassina/firestore-checkpoint-ts`), and usage guide. Document the library’s purpose (e.g., “persisting and restoring LangGraphJS state using Firestore”), the main classes/functions, and how to configure them. Ensure the example integration (from above) is included or referenced. Add badges for npm version, build status, test coverage, and license (if applicable) to increase professionalism. A well-documented README instills confidence and helps developers get started quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **ESLint and Code Style**              | **Implement ESLint for code quality.** Add an ESLint configuration (for TypeScript) to enforce consistent style and catch potential issues. Use a popular base config (like Airbnb or Google style for TS, or `eslint:recommended` plus TypeScript plugins) and adjust rules as needed for the project. Run ESLint on the codebase and fix any warnings or errors. This will improve readability and maintainability. You might also include a Prettier setup or integrate Prettier with ESLint for consistent formatting. Having linting ensures the code meets a standard before every commit/CI run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **CommonJS & ESM Support**             | **Ensure dual CommonJS and ESM module compatibility.** Update the build/output so that consumers can use the library in both Node.js (CommonJS, using `require`) and modern bundlers or Node ES Modules (using `import`). Typically, this involves: <ul><li>Configuring TypeScript or a bundler (like **tsup**, Rollup, or tsc with multiple configs) to produce two builds – one for CJS (e.g., in a `dist/cjs` folder or as a `.cjs` file) and one for ESM (e.g., `dist/esm` or `.mjs` files).</li><li>Updating **`package.json`** with appropriate fields: `"main"` (pointing to the CJS entry, e.g., `dist/cjs/index.js`), `"module"` (pointing to the ESM entry, e.g. `dist/esm/index.js`), and an `"exports"` map specifying both versions. For example, an exports field can conditionally provide ESM vs CJS files for importers.</li><li>Setting the `"type"` field in package.json appropriately (likely `"type": "commonjs"` if defaulting to CJS for .js files, or use explicit .cjs/.mjs extensions if `"type": "module"`).</li></ul>Ensuring this dual support will make the package usable in a variety of environments without bundler issues. |
| **Package Name & Metadata**            | **Use the scoped package name and review package.json metadata.** Update **`package.json`** `"name"` to `"@cassina/firestore-checkpoint-ts"` (as decided). Double-check other fields: version number (set an appropriate version for initial release, e.g. 1.0.0), description, keywords (include “Firestore”, “LangGraphJS”, etc.), author, and license. If this is a public package, add **`"publishConfig": { "access": "public" }`** so that the scoped package publishes publicly on npm. Including a LICENSE file (e.g. MIT) is also recommended if not already present. Proper metadata ensures the package is correctly identified and legally compliant on npm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Compatibility with LangGraphJS**     | **Verify integration with latest LangGraphJS API.** Since the library is meant to work with LangGraphJS, test it against the latest version of LangGraphJS to confirm there are no breaking changes. Ensure that any expected interface or class structure matches what LangGraphJS expects. For instance, if LangGraphJS expects a certain method like `loadCheckpoint()` or specific callback signatures, our library should implement those accordingly. If LangGraphJS is listed as a peerDependency (optional, if others will install it separately), specify an appropriate version range in `package.json` for clarity (or at least document the required LangGraphJS version in the README). Verifying this compatibility now prevents runtime errors for users and confirms the library’s value proposition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Testing (Unit & Integration)**       | **Maintain high test coverage and add integration tests.** The current test coverage meets the set thresholds (implying a solid unit test suite). Ensure these tests cover all core functionality. In addition, consider writing **integration tests** that simulate using the library in a real scenario – for example, actually saving and retrieving a checkpoint from a Firestore emulator while interacting with a mock LangGraphJS flow (if feasible). Since a Firestore emulator is already being used (as evidenced by the log), you can leverage it to test the full cycle of checkpoint save/restore. Verify edge cases (e.g., handling network errors or improper data) are tested as well. Maintaining thorough tests will prevent regressions and instill confidence in the stability of the package.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Continuous Integration (CI)**        | **Set up a CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) for automated testing and linting.** Configure CI to run on each push/PR to the main branch. The CI workflow should: <ul><li>Install dependencies and the Firebase emulator (if required for tests).</li><li>Run ESLint to ensure coding standards.</li><li>Build the project (compile TypeScript) for both module formats.</li><li>Start the Firestore emulator service before tests (this can be done via a GitHub Action service or using Firebase CLI), then run the test suite.</li><li>Report test results and code coverage (optionally upload coverage to a service or at least ensure it meets thresholds).</li></ul> Automating these steps catches issues early and ensures every change maintains quality. For example, a GitHub Actions YAML might use the official Firebase emulator action to set up Firestore, then use `npm run test` to execute tests in the workflow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Continuous Deployment (Release)**    | **Streamline publishing to npm with CI/CD.** In addition to CI for testing, set up a workflow for releasing the package to npm. This could be manually triggered or automated on tagging a new version. For instance, you can have GitHub Actions job that runs on a version tag push: it would build the library, then run `npm publish`. Make sure to use an npm token (stored as a secret) and that the `package.json` has the correct publish config (scope and access as mentioned). Alternatively, integrate a tool like **semantic-release** to handle version bumping and publishing automatically based on commit messages. A CI-based publish process reduces manual error and ensures the npm package is updated consistently alongside the repository.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Code Quality and Maintainability**   | **Additional quality improvements.** Consider adding a few more polish items: <ul><li>**Prettier** for consistent code formatting (can be run pre-commit or in CI alongside ESLint).</li><li>**Husky + lint-staged** to run linting/tests on pre-commit or pre-push, preventing bad commits.</li><li>Review dependency versions: ensure that the Firestore SDK (e.g., Firebase Admin SDK or Firestore client) and any other deps are up-to-date and compatible with each other. Upgrade if needed to avoid using deprecated methods.</li><li>Check for any performance or security considerations (for example, ensure no sensitive info is hard-coded, and the Firestore usage follows best practices for batching or avoiding excessive reads).</li><li>Perform a final audit of the TypeScript types – make sure `.d.ts` files are generated or the types are exported in `package.json` (`"types": "dist/index.d.ts"` for example) so that consumers get proper IntelliSense.</li></ul> These steps further ensure the package is maintainable long-term and meets typical open-source quality standards.                                                  |
